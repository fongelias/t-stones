# t-stones
this repo is used to practice algos, data structures, design patterns, etc. while also serving the purpose of creating well documented, reusable, educational code.

## structure
the source code is broken down into several parts:

- kata: problems, special tests used as ways to learn the application of code
  - k1: simply complete the problem in code
  - k2: complete the problem again, using stones
- stones: building blocks of algos and data structures, generalized over time through k2s
- meta: utility scripts meant to be used only within the context of this repo



## author's note
if you would like to use this as a way to study, simply delete all the non-test files, so that all tests fail, and begin from there. at this point in time, i do not have a command to run in the shell for such a thing.
